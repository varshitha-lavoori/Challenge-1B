# 📑 Round 1B — Approach Explanation (Persona-Driven Document Intelligence)

## 🧩 1️⃣ Overview

For this round, the goal is to build an intelligent document processor that extracts and ranks the most relevant sections from multiple PDFs, tailored for a given persona and a specific task.

---

## 👤 2️⃣ Persona & Job

In this example:

- **Persona:** Undergraduate Chemistry Student
- **Job-to-be-done:** Identify key concepts and mechanisms for exam preparation on reaction kinetics.

The script must understand the job and find relevant sections within the given documents that match this intent.

---

## 🔍 3️⃣ Methodology

The solution uses **PyMuPDF** for fast, local PDF parsing:

- Reads each PDF page-by-page.
- Breaks pages into text blocks.
- Scores each block by matching **keywords** derived from the job description.
- Keeps blocks with the highest scores as candidate sections.
- Sorts and limits these to the top-ranked sections.

Each relevant section includes:

- The PDF filename
- Page number
- A trimmed preview of the section title
- An importance rank (based on keyword match count)

A simple **sub-section** analysis reuses the same text for baseline demonstration.

---

## ⚙️ 4️⃣ Key Design Choices

- **No external API calls:** Runs 100% offline.
- **No heavy ML model:** Just keyword matching to stay under 1GB limit.
- **Fully CPU-only:** Compatible with AMD64.
- **Fast:** Finishes within the 60-second limit for 3–5 moderate PDFs.
- **Generic:** Works with any PDF + persona + job description combo by simply updating `persona_job.json`.

---

## ✅ 5️⃣ Output

A single `result.json` is produced with:

- `metadata` (docs, persona, job, timestamp)
- `extracted_sections` (top-ranked sections)
- `sub_section_analysis` (same text for baseline)

The approach is modular and can be easily extended for smarter NLP or section classification in future rounds.

---

## 🏆 6️⃣ Next Steps

For maximum impact:

- Replace the simple scorer with NLP phrase matching or BERT embeddings.
- Add support for section headings and context.
- Improve ranking by weighting matches by frequency and section size.

---

**This approach ensures a working, explainable, offline baseline that satisfies all Round 1B constraints.**

✨ Let’s connect the dots!
